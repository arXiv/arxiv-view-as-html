def find_main_tex_source(path: str) -> str:
    """
    Looks inside the directory at "path" and determines the
    main .tex source. Assumes that the main .tex file
    must start with "documentclass". To account for
    common Overleaf templates that have multiple .tex
    files that start with "documentclass", assumes that
    the main .tex file is not of class "standalone"
    or "subfiles".

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        File path to a directory containing unzipped .tex source
